# Hi there! :wave:

## :rocket: About Me
Hi, I'm **Alyssa Juarez**! I'm a **December 2024 graduate** with a **Bachelor of Science** in **Data Science** concentrating in **Mathematics** from the **University of Texas at Arlington**. My academic background has provided me with a strong foundation in **statistics** and **data modeling**. Though I have studied these subjects extensively, I believe there is always room for improvement and further learning.

As a highly organized and detail-oriented individual, my main driving factor is to push myself to be better. As Ernest Hemingway once said, "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self." I strive to embody this philosophy every day by embracing growth, remaining open to new opportunities, and continuously seeking ways to improve.
